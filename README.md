# GROUND_STATION
MODEL SATELLITE GROUND STATION
In this project, an interface was prepared for the visualization of telemetric data (roll, pitch, yaw, temperature, pressure, height, etc.) and live image stream received from the model satellite at the ground station. At the same time, this interface can be used to send a file package and save the data in the table to excel.
